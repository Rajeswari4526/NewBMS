# NewBMS

Bug Management System is used to keeptrack of the bugs in a project.
This is built using technologies ASP.NET MVC 4, Razor Markup, Entity Framework - Code first approach, SQL Server 2014, Bootstrap, Github - version controlling, Hosting-Microsoft Azure.

We can navigate through the application using the top navigation bar.
We can add and edit the bugs in the "Bugs" section. The options (Projects, Categories, Employees, Priorities...) that we see while adding the bug are configurable.

Work in Progress:
Improve User interface.
Improve Models (add more columns to improve DB design).
Explore Repository Pattern (Unit of Work) and evaluate if it applies.

Future scope (To maintain industry levels):
Dependency injection through StructureMap.
Effective logging through librarys like Serilog.
